# chatbot-fds
This code is a practical implementation of a Chatbot created using the Chatterbot module.  
Created by: Afraa Noureen and Ravali Attivilli

## **Pre-requisites:** 
1. Python should be pre-installed in the PC 
2. pip should be installed in the terminal
3. Install chatterbot, chatterbot-corpus , flask and SQLAlchemy, nltk
4. An IDE/terminal to run the code

## **Commands to download the pre-requisites:**

```
>pip install chatterbot 
>pip install chatterbot-corpus >=1.2.0
>pip install SQLAlchemy >= 1.2
>pip install Flask >= 1.0.0
>pip install nltk
```

**Note:** if you are using Python3 use pip3 instead of pip

## **Implementation:**
1. Import the project into your IDE or go the project directory
2. Import all the files in one directory 
3. Change the path for the variable “dirname” in chatbot_train.py to that of your directory where all your files are located.

## **Running the code:**
In the terminal window present in your IDE/your PC terminal change the directory to the one where all your files are stored.
Run > python chatbot_train.py in your terminal
Let your chatbot get trained, once trained successfully.
Run > python app.py in your terminal 
This should be your output:

```
* Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**You can now interact with the chatbot present in the browser window.**
